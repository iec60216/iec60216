- 👋 Hi, I’m @iec60216
- 👀 I’m interested in developing software for the algorithms described in the IEC 60216 standards (especially parts 3, 5 and 6).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to use Github for commiting new versions of my tool. V1.00 was already published at [IEC-TC112](https://www.iec.ch/dyn/www/f?p=103:227:0::::FSP_ORG_ID,FSP_LANG_ID:1310,25).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on integrating Github into Netbeans and Java programming and upgrading the code to beyond Java 8.
